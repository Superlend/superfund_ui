        question: "Why doesn't my APY match the advertised rate on day one?",
        answer: "When you deposit into SuperFund, your earnings (APY) don't start at the full rate right away. That's because we use a \"Yield Ramp-up\" system ‚Äî built on Euler Earn ‚Äî to make rates more stable and fair over time.",

        question: "What's Yield Ramp-up?",
        answer: "Think of SuperFund like a candy machine üç¨ that gives out candies (yield) slowly and evenly, so everyone gets a fair share ‚Äî not all at once. When the vault earns yield, it's added to a pool and released gradually over 7 days. This prevents sudden spikes and keeps returns smooth for everyone.",

        question: "What This Means For You",
        answer: "If you're a new depositor, your APY will start low and ramp up over about 7 days. You'll miss a small portion of your first week's yield (around 3 days' worth) because your funds didn't help generate the yield that's already being shared. And the new yield your funds generate also enters the \"slow drip.\" Don't worry ‚Äî after that ramp-up, you'll earn like everyone else.",
